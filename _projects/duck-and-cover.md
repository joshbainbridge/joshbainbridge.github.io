title: Duck and Cover Animation
order: 7
date: 2015, Mar

This animation was created during a group project at Bournemouth University. It tells the story of an unfortunate duck and his rather (tasty) end. My responsibilities were handling the general pipeline as well as the simulation, lighting and compositing.

- Fire simulation created using DOPs in Houdini
- Lighting and rendering using Mantra and VRay
- Compositing
- Pipeline

The simulation used a two stage process of first creating a fuel, then the ignition. This gave the flames a directional velocity and correctly modelled the flamethrower like effect that we were after. This was then upresed and compressed to allow for faster iteration and rendering.

An example frame of just the flame simulation can be seen below.
