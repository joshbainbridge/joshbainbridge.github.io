This is a procedural city tool I developed for Houdini while studying at Bournemouth University. I designed it to produce point data that represents the external walls of a building or town. This data is then used to construct geometry from prefabricated segments or exported directly to be used elsewhere. 

- Portable Houdini OTL
- Artistic input and control
- Extendible
- Fast iteration

Allowing the point data to be exported independently means it can be used in other ways or extended. Also having the segments built externally in a modular fashion gave real artistic control to the user.

You can download the otl and an example for non-commercial use [here](/assets/data/city_tool.zip).
