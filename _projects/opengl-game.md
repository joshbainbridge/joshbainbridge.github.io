title: Interactive OpenGL Game
order: 5
date: 2013, Jul

This was my first exploration into programming with c++ and is intedid to be an independent and experimental game called Craft. It is experimental in both style and procedural gameplay, blending between two and three dimensional worlds with varying detail and colour.

- First program developed in c++
- Use of modern OpenGL
- Experimental gameplay and style

Techniques such as instancing, octree structures and procedural noise are currently being used to create the environment although a character still needs to be added. The controls are just arrows + wasd keys and the source should compile on most platform.
