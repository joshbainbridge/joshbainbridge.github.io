Welcome to my site and very small corner of the internet. I built this to not only host my portfolio but also (in time) to be a resource for others in a collaborative sense, as the online community has been to me. I study primarily as an animation software engineer but also have experience as a technical artist. Here you will find a range of work from the technical to the more artistically driven projects. I'll try to upload source code and resources whenever I can.
