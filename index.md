Welcome to my site and very small corner of the internet. I built this to not only host my personal portfolio, but also (in time) to be a resource for others in a collaborative sense, as the online community has been to me. Currently I'm a Rendering Engineer working in the visual effects industry out of London. Here you will find a range of work from the technical to the more creatively inclined projects. I'll try to upload source code and resources whenever I can.
